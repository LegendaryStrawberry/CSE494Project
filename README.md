CSE494Project
=============

Project for CSE494 mobile computing

For my mobile computing project I chose to research and develop code that would get movie titles/scores from multiple websites with their persmisson.

The goal was to create some sort of mobile application that required some research involved. Being in this class was the first time I have ever wrote code for mobile phones so my choice was to use JavaScript Oject Notation to transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs. Another research goal of mine was to see how power consumption and lattency time was affected by the amount of different websites the application called at once.
